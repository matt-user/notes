## Set Theory

* discuss objects and relationships between them
* set is collection of distinct objects
* every set is contained by itself
* difference - set of elements in A but not in B
* union - set of elements in A or B
* intersection - set of elements in A and B
* symmetric difference - set of elements in A or B but not in both
* cartesian product - set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B
* function is rule from A to B.  A is domain, B is codomain.
* cardinality - number of elements in a set

## Group Theory

* a group is a set with a binary operation that satisfies four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility
* abelian group - commutative group under binary operation
* function is homomorphism if it preserves the group operation
* isomorphism - bijective homomorphism 
* group is cyclic if there exists an element g in the group such that every element in the group can be written as g^n for some integer n

## Ring Theory

* structure - set R with two binary operations, add and mul
* abelian, monoid, distributive
* ideal of a ring is subset a - b is in I for all a, b in I

## Field Theory

* fiest is set with 2 binary operations, usually add and mul
* finite fields are galois fields

## Field Extensions

* field E containing F as subfield.
* tower of field extensions - is seq of fields
