# CPU Optimization

* efficiency - optimal utilization of resources
* speed - how quick program executes
* latency - execution time per unit number of instructions on the CPU
* throughput - number of instructions per second
* only a small portion of code causes performance issues
* performance enhancements rely on data and CPU -> test should be done first
* compiler generates - different assemply instructions for different data types
