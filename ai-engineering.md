* set of all tokens - vocabulary
* tokens help process unknown words
* masked language model - predict missing tokens anywhere in a sequence
* used for non generative tasks

* completions are based on predictions
* parameter - variable within ML model that is updated during training
* RAG - retrieval augmented generation, database to supplement
