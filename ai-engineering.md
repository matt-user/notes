# AI Engineering

## Chapter 1

* running out of public data to train on
* model as a service
* AI engineering - building apps on top of models
* language model - stat info about 1 or more languages
* how likely a word appears given a context
* token - smallest unit of text in a language model
* set of all tokens - vocabulary
* tokens help process unknown words
* masked language model - predict missing tokens anywhere in a sequence
* used for non generative tasks
* auto regressive model - next token based on previous tokens
* completions are based on predictions
* parameter - variable within ML model that is updated during training
* RAG - retrieval augmented generation, database to supplement

* query - retrieve data chunks most relevant to the query
* sparse vector - vector with many zeros
* dense vector - vector with few zeros
* term based - relevance at lexical level
* embedding based - relevance at semantic level
